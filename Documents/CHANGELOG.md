# Changelog

## v0.1.4

### Known Issues

* Multi monitor setups may show the window on the wrong monitor.
* Windowed mode allows setting a too large resolution, which does not fit on screen. Use alt-enter to fix it.
* Sometimes when switching display mode and resolution simultaneously, the resolution will not be applied.

### Features

* You can now set resolution in borderless fullscreen.
* You can now opt in or out of sending analytics data from the settings menu.

### Fixes

* Performance:
  * Improved Atmospheric Scattering frametime by 33% by using float16 for the LUT format.
* Logging:
  * Fix a bug where long messages are truncated.
  * Redesigned and simplified a bunch of internal APIs around logging which should improve quality of logs.
* UI:
  * Scale the "Confirm" button in the postcard interface with the resolution.
* Crashes:
  * Avoid a highly annoying crash where we can set the screenshot readback buffer to not match the swapchain size.
    * This one was tricky to hunt down because many graphics cards don't crash, despite it being clearly wrong.
  * Improved unsupported hardware detection to use hardware features instead of names.
  
### Invisible Work

* A large amount of work has been done to reduce tech debt following the first release and help prepare for future work.

## v0.1.3

### Features

* Provide a more click-able format for deeplinks
  * [See the new deeplink documentation](https://github.com/PLAYERUNKNOWN-Productions/Preface-User-Support/wiki/A-Guide-to-DeepLink-(Fast-Travelling-in-Preface))
* PST-2504 - Improve unsupported hardware and OS detection and user-facing messaging

### Fixes

* Windowing
  * PST-2461 - Prevent mouse being captured in full screen mode with DPI scaling
  * PST-2462 - Handle updating UI hitboxes when switching to Borderless Fullscreen from Exclusive Fullscreen with a non-desktop resolution
  * PST-2440 - Fix Preface logo getting drawn before ui scaling is calculated
* Logging
  * Ensure the last line of logs is always added to output
* Performance
  * Fix memory leak in and optimize `string_builder`
  * PST-2470 - Prevent new waypoints requests during flight and ensure they are streamed in when landing
* Crashes
  * PST-2447 - Fix render model load crash
    * When a model is no longer used, don't destroy its resources if an async job is working on processing textures for it
* Troubleshooting
  * `reset_preface.bat` now also deletes the shader cache
    * This works around an issue where occasionally the cache could be corrupted
